# EDA-of-Airbnb-Listings
This project analyzes NYC Airbnb listings to identify factors affecting rental prices. Room type and neighbourhood are the strongest influences, with entire homes and Manhattan listings being pricier. Other factors like host listing count and availability have moderate impact, while reviews and minimum nights show minimal effect.
